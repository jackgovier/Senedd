We hope to see this trend continue. Our substance misuse delivery plan 2016-18 sets out the actions we are taking to raise awareness of the dangers of underage drinking in Wales, including guidance and education campaigns to raise awareness of alcohol related harm. The Welsh Government continues to provide over £2m to the all Wales schools core liaison programme which operates in 100% of schools across Wales and delivers substance misuse education to children and young people at all key stages of the school curriculum.

The framework is being developed by local government in partnership with third sector and other agencies, supported by project development funding from the Welsh Government.  The framework aims to ensure that the best quality foster care placements are available to children who need them, and that foster carers are valued, supported and receive excellent training. Foster carers have been actively involved in shaping the framework. A key objective is to achieve a more consistent approach to recruiting and supporting foster carers. Progress in implementing the framework will be overseen by the Ministerial Advisory Group on Improving Outcomes for Children, chaired by David Melding AM.  The Improving Outcomes for Children programme will be informed by relevant research and approaches, including recent work on Adverse Childhood Experiences in the lives of looked after children and children on the edge of care.  We are funding two fostering organisations under the Sustainable Social Services grant programme for three years from 2016-17. The Excellence in Foster Care Wales project being delivered by the Fostering Network is supporting foster carers and fostering services to improve outcomes for children and young people in foster care.

Tackling the stigma and discrimination associated with mental illness are key to this. That is why we have supported the Time to Change Wales (TTCW) programme with the Big Lottery fund and Comic Relief since 2012 and have continued to support and work with TTCW, through Phase 2 of the programme along with Comic Relief. We also support the TTCW campaign by embedding the key messages throughout our programmes, for example tackling stigma is a core element of our Healthy Working Wales Programme, which engages with a wide range of organisations across Wales. Learning from experiences of young people with mental health problems is one of the most effective ways to change the negative behaviour and attitudes of others. TTCW’s Young Person’s Programme funded by the Big Lottery is a 3 year focused anti-stigma and discrimination programme led by, and for, young people, building on the Time To Change Wales work with adults. Over the course of the project, 50 Young Champions are expected to directly engage with at least 5,000 young people. This involves working in partnership with nine schools clustered in three areas across Wales embedding a whole school approach to mental health awareness, anti-stigma messaging and activity. It is hoped that by the end of the project over 20,000 young people will have engaged with the associated social marketing campaign. Regular monitoring is a core element of the programme and is embedded in the partnership agreement. Phase 1 of the programme (2012-2014) has been evaluated to seek evidence on attitudes and behaviours of the general public, and target audiences and campaign participants including TTCW champions. The public attitude survey has been repeated for Phase 2 of the programme, with the final report expected in Summer 2017. In terms of young people, data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) study suggest that the proportions reporting high life satisfaction have remained stable over time[1]. Similarly, adult data from the Welsh Health Survey show that mental (and physical) wellbeing scores have remained similar since 2003/04, although there has been a slight decline in mental wellbeing scores[2]. Moving forward, in February 2017, we will be supporting three mental health charities, Mind, Cymru, Gofal and Hafal with a State of Stigma event. The event will bring together key organisations and professionals to consider the work undertaken in Wales by TTCW along with wider work across the UK. The event will provide an invaluable opportunity to help inform our thinking and assist in the development of future work and priorities.

In addition, the National Literacy and Numeracy Framework, which has been a statutory curriculum requirement since September 2013, contains a 'manage money' element clearly setting out year on year progression in learners' development of these important skills. In September 2015 a new statutory programme of study for mathematics was introduced across primary and secondary settings with the literacy and numeracy components of the LNF embedded within it, including the manage money strand. Consequently, financial education and money management now also features within the new GCSEs in Mathematics and Mathematics – Numeracy, which commenced first teaching last September. The Welsh Government has developed a suite of resources, made available on Hwb and the Learning Wales websites. Teachers can use these to enhance subject knowledge and identify opportunities to deliver financial education in the classroom. We have asked our independent Inspectorate for Education and Training in Wales, Estyn, to undertake a thematic review on the quality of provision of financial education in primary and secondary schools. I want this review to consider how well the teaching and learning of financial education is progressing to inform future curriculum development. The Estyn review will also give us a clear steer on areas for improvement, and indicate areas of good practice for schools and regional consortia. Successful Futures recommends that the curriculum is organised into Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLE) with literacy, numeracy and digital competence as cross-curriculum responsibilities, recognising these skills to be essential to successful participation in the modern world. My officials are currently working with teaching professionals from the Pioneer Schools Network on the design and development of the new curriculum and assessment arrangements.

There was an 8 % decrease in greenhouse gas emissions in 2014 compared with 2013. This is predominantly driven by a reduction in the use of coal in the power generation sector, a reduction in emissions from refineries and the residential sector. Wales has a proportionately high share of the UK’s electricity generation and heavy industry and is a net exporter of energy. This means electricity and other energy products such as refined oils, produced in Wales are exported and subsequently consumed by homes and businesses across the UK. Taking these energy exports into account, emissions based on Wales’ end-use consumption of energy are lower and have reduced further since 1990 (30 per cent reduction). Despite the improved performance in 2014, we recognise further action is needed to meet the 40 % target by 2020.

The TPSM projects the desired number of teachers required based on pupil projections and current pupil-teacher ratios.

These flows cover the in-flow of newly qualified teachers and re-entrants to teaching in Wales, and the loss of teachers due to retirements and other reasons for leaving. In addition, we are working on bringing regulations into force which would enable the collection of a greater level of information on the school workforce in Wales. This will help to consolidate and improve our school workforce intelligence and to enable effective workforce planning to ensure that the right people with the right skills are deployed to provide a committed and motivated workforce. We have kept ITET intake targets at a steady state in recent years following a period of substantial reduction to overall numbers and while the review and reform of ITET is underway. The Welsh Government encourages all three ITET Centres to actively promote their courses to attract and recruit the very best and brightest individuals with the right skills and personal qualities to consider teaching as a career.

SBRI is a recognised process that supports the public sector in procuring the development of new technical solutions and accelerating technology adoption. New ideas can be explored as risk is managed through a phased development programme running a portfolio of the most promising projects. SBRI enables the public sector to engage with industry during the early stages of development and operates under the EU Pre-commercial Procurement legal framework. Contracts awarded to businesses must be for research and development activities only (i. e. not commercial activity as otherwise conventional procurement practices apply). The applications developed through SBRI are subject to procurement rules at the point of commercialisation. The purpose is therefore to stimulate the market to develop new technology products and services which have the potential to address defined challenges which are unmet. Solutions proposed can and do come from different industry sectors and due to the competitive nature of the process, organisations from anywhere in the UK and EU may be successful in winning contracts. In this case, it is extremely positive that both of the companies who were successful in winning phase 2 demonstrator contracts came from Wales. Decisions about whether or not to use the new products developed (usually meaning purchasing or paying for them) is one that organisations and in this case ABMU Health Board must take based on the merits and affordability of the finished product.

It is imperative that universities in Wales deliver the highest quality courses and best teaching standards for students so they have the skills and degree level qualifications they need to succeed in employment.

The role of monitoring institutions is undertaken by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW). HEFCW's Corporate Strategy includes a number of national targets for improvement and the Funding Council engages with, and monitors, the sector to encourage progress. League tables are only one way of measuring the performance of a higher education institution, and are not particularly strong in reflecting the contribution and performance of universities in some of our key priority areas, such widening access and encouraging their wider role in society.

Like farmers, many milk processors have been making low margins as they compete to retain their market share. The Welsh Government continues to support farmers to increase their profits by improving both technical and business efficiencies whilst taking full advantage of their milk contract. The advice and support available through Farming Connect along with the work of AHDB Dairy helps farmers develop their business and be more resilient to market volatility. We are in a competitive position compared to many other milk producing areas, with a favourable climate for grass growth and a concentrated milk field. I recognise from the dairy processing capacity study the last Welsh Government funded in South West Wales, that there is also an opportunity to extend our processing capacity here in Wales.

However, much has changed since 2003 when this grant was first introduced, including the introduction of a free update service for volunteers so that only an initial check incurs a cost. The same update service is also available to staff employed in the Third Sector for just £13 per annum. We cannot continue to do things the same way when there are alternative, more cost effective, options available. Our engagement with Third Sector stakeholders has highlighted the need for a wider focus on safeguarding. This recognises that DBS checks are just one part of the practices which all organisations working with children or vulnerable adults must have in place. Welsh Government will continue to support work in this area, placing a strong emphasis on embedding safeguarding practices where they are needed most. Some funding has been earmarked for continuing support for the Third Sector with regard to safeguarding. Initial proposals for the use of this funding have been received from WCVA and I will consider these and arrangement for the use of the funding shortly. I am also considering the provision for DBS checks to be undertaken through the medium of Welsh, if Third Sector organisations experience difficulties in this regard with other providers. As part of this, Welsh Government is continuing to work closely with the Disclosure and Barring Service to ensure that Welsh language provision is widely available for Third Sector organisations and others. Assurances have already been received from Disclosure and Barring Service that their new online services which are due to launch this autumn will be fully bilingual. The previous Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty agreed to extend the current grant to support WCVA’s Criminal Records Unit (CRU) to the end of September 2016 only. This extension was agreed specifically to allow time for stakeholders to identify alternative arrangements for carrying out DBS checks. WCVA has worked closely with stakeholders to help them through this process including identifying alternative, cost effective providers for DBS checks. With Third Sector Support Wales doing more to promote increased awareness of the availability of the free update service and implementation of check ‘portability’ across organisations, the impact of the withdrawal of the Welsh Government funding is expected to be greatly reduced. I remain clear that the previous Minister’s decision was the right one; transitional funding for the Third Sector to carry out DBS checks will end in September 2016.",FALSE,FALSE,638

I have provided an update below against each of the recommendations from the inquiry and you will see that many of these are being implemented or progressed through the new marketing campaign. Recommendation 1 – This recommendation was accepted in principle and was implemented via the primary care workforce plan and HPEI review. Full consideration has been given to the possibility of increasing the number of GP training places but given that there are a number of places that remain unfilled, it remains the position that increasing the number at this point in time does not represent the best allocation of funding. However, this situation will be kept under review. Recommendation 2 – This recommendation has already been implemented. A new process has been introduced this year to consider whether changes should be made to the number of specialty training posts for the 2017/18 intake. The outcome of this process is being discussed with NHS Chief Executives and I expect to receive advice in the coming weeks.

Recommendations 4 to 6 – These recommendations began their implementation through the primary care workforce plan and are now being further progressed under the recruitment and marketing campaign and the GP offer, which is due to launch in October. I will be making a statement in Plenary on the campaign on Tuesday 20 September. Recommendation 7 – This matter is being taken forward through the “widening access” programme of work. During the summer recess, I also met the deans of both medical schools in Wales, and they identified the importance of reviewing the activities already in place to encourage Welsh students to aspire to a career in medicine - and to encourage them to consider starting their education for that career here in Wales. Promoting medical careers to those students already in Wales will be another facet of the marketing campaign, in addition to the other elements aiming to attract those from outside of Wales. Recommendation 8 – Officials have been in discussions with NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership (NWSSP) to develop a career conversations service, not only for those nearing retirement but for those thinking of leaving Wales or general practice entirely. The work is in its early stages of development but will feature as part of the longer term offer to GPs under the recruitment campaign. There has already been some development for GP trainees in this area (also undertaken by NWSSP), in the form of entry and exit interviews, for those about to embark on their training and those nearing the end. This helps establish early expectations and the reality of their experiences of training in Wales as well as trying to explore the reasons behind those trainees who either stay in Wales or leave to work elsewhere.

The Welsh Government is the awarding body for the NPQH and in partnership with the four regional education consortia, funds, administers and delivers the national assessment programme which focuses on the required skills and attributes of headship as articulated in the The Head Teachers' Qualifications and Registration (Wales) Regulations 2005 leadership standards. We know that many previous participants on the NPQH programmes have not chosen to move into headship on attainment of the qualification. To address this, the selection process for NPQH was revisited in 2015. The revised selection process initiated with the last cohort, (the 2015-16 round), replaced the national selection process and quota of candidates with a regional process. These changes to last year's programme resulted in a total of 171 candidates being assessed: 40 more candidates than the previous year. Following a process of regional and national moderation 136 were judged to have met the Leadership Standards and were awarded the NPQH. It also needs to be recognised that it is a big step up from assistant or deputy headship to full headship. The current NPQH qualification is delivered as an assessment centre which enables participants to compile evidence in order to demonstrate that they meet the standards determined within NPQH (the leadership standards). The current provision however does not offer professional development for candidates in order to prepare them for the challenge of headship. Even when participants are able to evidence the standards they may require support and professional development to ensure they are more fully prepared by the NPQH to take up headship. To address this, working with the regional consortia, my officials have developed an enriched and augmented NPQH offer for 2016-17. The augmented offer supplements the delivery of NPQH to include development days as part of the process. Additionally, in June I announced a major review of the school governance framework to make it easier to recruit governors with the relevant skills experience and expertise. One of the most important jobs that governors have to undertake is the appointment of a headteacher. In order to strengthen the appointment process and make it more robust, the proposals for the new regulations include giving governing bodies additional support for headteacher and deputy headteacher appointment panels, for all types of schools. Governing bodies will be required to appoint at least one independent person with relevant professional experience and expertise. This person will have an automatic vote. Currently the chief education officer has an automatic right to attend headteacher and deputy headteacher appointment panels to advise the governors.

Delivery of the third year is underway and the funding model remains dynamic so that priorities can be addressed as they emerge. Given this fluidity, final funding allocations for the third year are not yet available. The money spent on the programme reflects the levels of support identified by: Pathways to Success Schools and their Advisers to support their journeys of improvement; and, regional education consortia to build capacity for improvement more widely in the system. When considering the outcomes that the programme has delivered, improvements in attainment are often the key indicators that are reported on publicly. With that in mind, after one year of support the majority of schools improved their attainment of the Level 2 inclusive. Verified results following the second year of the programme are not yet available but will be published in December. However, exam success is only one indicator that should be considered when assessing the benefits of the Challenge.

It is vital that businesses in Wales are not disadvantaged through unnecessary trade barriers such as tariffs, quotas or technical barriers to trade. Extensive analytical and policy work is underway covering both economic and broader issues – taking into account different potential future models and outcomes – which is directly contributing to Ministerial discussions on priorities. We are also engaging widely with stakeholders to gain their first hand insights. Leaving the EU Single Market and Customs Union would have very far-reaching and, in most respects, detrimental impacts on many sectors. Sectors we are considering include, but are not limited to Advanced Manufacturing and Materials; Agriculture, Food and Drink, Fisheries; Creative Industries; Energy; Financial Services and Professional and Business Services; Higher Education and Research; Infrastructure, Construction, Housing; Tourism; Consumer and Retail; Water and Waste; Defence; Life Sciences; and Digital and Telecoms. However, it is not possible to forecast with certainty the precise impact on jobs in Wales at this stage. Analysis undertaken so far has indicated that, in addition to an impact on jobs, over the long run, significant negative effects are likely to take the form of lower levels of GVA, real wages, incomes, and tax revenues than would otherwise have been expected. As well as identifying areas of potential vulnerability, we are also seeking to identify potential opportunities in sectors such as tourism, which may benefit from the weaker sterling exchange rate seen since the referendum result.

At the time of deployment that was the Department for Energy and Climate Change, now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and signed off by the Secretary of State for Energy. Part of any decommissioning plan requires financial security, to be payable in full, and in advance of the commencement of deployment into an escrow type account which neither party can withdraw money from without the approval of the other party, unless in matters of insolvency on the part of the developer. The financial security must be for the full value of decommissioning costs of the DeltaStream. This amount remains in the escrow account until such a time that the DeltaStream needs to be recovered. This sum has been calculated to be sufficient to recover the device back to port and to place the seabed back to the condition it was in prior to deployment.

RE aims to help learners to explore fundamental questions relating to human experience, relationships and responsibilities, whilst also helping them to learn about beliefs based on both secular and religious values. It is not intended for RE to promote a particular faith or belief. The National Exemplar Framework for RE for 3 to 19-year-olds in Wales was published to support local authorities (through their Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education) to design agreed syllabuses that ensure consistency across Wales and seek to raise standards. As you are aware the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015 includes a new duty on schools and colleges to “have due regard, in the exercise of their functions, to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism”, the UK Government published the Prevent Duty Guidance: for England and Wales for specified public bodies, including education providers. The Welsh Government subsequently updated the guidance document 'Respect and resilience' in January 2016. This guidance supports the development of community cohesion and prevents extremism in schools and other educational settings in Wales, ensuring they are able to meet the legal requirements of the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act 2015. The guidance is non-age specific, covering the Foundation Phase, primary and secondary stages and provides clear, practical advice. The reformed Welsh Baccalaureate introduced for first teaching in September 2015 also includes an option through the Global Citizenship Challenge to allow schools in Wales to address the issue of extremism through an accredited Challenge brief. Due to the sensitive nature of the topic a resource pack to accompany this challenge has been produced by the Getting on Together (GOT) Challenging Extremism programme. Looking ahead, the design of the new curriculum is being taken forward by a network of Pioneer Schools. They are working together as a single national network of schools to co-design, consult, inform, support and build capacity in schools across Wales, working with an all-Wales partnership with Welsh Government, Estyn, Higher Education, business and other key partners. Professor Graham Donaldson made it clear in ‘Successful Futures’ that RE should form part of the Humanities Area of Learning and Experience, and should remain a statutory curriculum requirement. Over the coming weeks, a working group of Pioneer Schools will be established to begin designing the Humanities Area of Learning and Experience. They will be engaging with stakeholders and experts during this period and there will be more formal opportunities for interested parties to comment on proposals in relation to the new curriculum, by way of surveys or consultation, at strategic points during development. The four purposes outlined in ‘Successful Futures’ will be central to the design of the new curriculum to ensure all our children and young people will be ethical, informed citizens who understand and exercise their human and democratic rights and responsibilities.

The science curriculum is designed to support learners' understanding on the range of interdependent organisms and their inter-relationships; including issues such as influenza, chronic illnesses and disease. This includes names, structure and functions of the human body. The effects of drugs, alcohol and tobacco on the human body are also explored, among other areas, to develop contextualised understanding about how lifestyle decisions impact health. The curriculum includes specific focus on the structure and function of cells, tissues, organs and organ systems and how they support vital life processes. This includes how food is used as fuel during respiration, why a balanced diet is needed for good health, and the benefits and detriments of insulin, steroids, paracetamol and caffeine on the human body. The science curriculum is statutory for all until age 16 and at Key Stage 4 learners can engage in more in depth through study of GCSE Biology. Within that, learners will develop greater understanding of disease and affects on human health. This includes particular focus on the different causes of disease; how diseases can be spread; good practice to minimise spread of diseases; and how diseases are treated, such as antibiotics. This will include specific focus on pathogens or micro organism diseases such as bacteria, viruses, protists and fungi and how they play a role in diseases of the tissue, blood and fluid membranes such as Sepsis and Meningitis. Improving the emotional and mental health of children and young people is a key priority for the Welsh Government. One of the aims of our second delivery plan (2016-19) supporting the implementation of Together for Mental Health, our 10-year mental health strategy, is helping children and young people to be more resilient and better able to cope with poor mental well-being. There are routes within the curriculum for schools to teach learners about mental health and different health conditions across all age groups through PSE, this is a statutory part of curriculum for all pupils aged 7-16 at maintained schools.  The PSE framework, which schools should use for planning PSE, contains five themes. One of these themes is Health and Emotional Wellbeing, which gives schools the opportunity to inform and discuss the affects of health conditions. Learners can be helped to improve their knowledge and practical skills to keep their mind and body safe and to make informed choices on nutrition, exercise, hygiene, safety and healthy choices. In the new curriculum and assessment arrangement currently being developed, will be designed to recognise that children and young people need to experience social, emotional and physical well-being to thrive and engage successfully with their education. The four purposes articulated in Successful Futures and which will be at the heart of the design of the new curriculum includes the aim that children should become healthy, confident individuals, ready to lead fulfilling lives as valued members of society. In addition, Health and well-being will be one of six Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLEs) which will be central to the structure of the new curriculum. The design of the new curriculum is being taken forward by a network of Pioneer Schools and practitioners working with education professionals and other experts across Wales and beyond (including; Estyn, consortia, Higher Education, business and other key partners). It is their collective expertise that will shape the new curriculum. Early in the New Year, working groups will be established to begin the design of the six AoLEs. The Health and well-being AoLE will draw on subjects and themes from mental, physical and emotional well-being. My ambition remains for the new curriculum to be made available to schools from 2018 and fully available to support learning and teaching by 2021.",FALSE,FALSE,1198

The Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act and the associated regulations have all been equality impact assessed and these documents have been published. These have informed a separate equality impact assessment which was undertaken for the new grant scheme, which considered the impact of the changes across all equality strands including disability. The Act promotes the well-being of all people with care and support needs. The grant scheme application guidance specifically referred to identifying how people with physical and/or sensory disabilities and with learning disabilities/autism would be supported to achieve their own well-being outcomes. 84 grant applications were received seeking just over £69 million. All applications were carefully considered as part of a competitive process matching applications to the advertised criteria and policy priorities. To ensure equity across sectors, the maximum grant awarded to any project over three years was £1. 5 million so no more than 10% of the overall funding available was allocated to a single proposal. At the end of 2015 nearly £22million of grant funding was announced for the next three years.

At this time, 28 primary schools still remain on connectivity below the minimum commitment. This does not necessarily mean that they are unable to access the Hwb platform, however it is recognised the experience of pupils may be severely affected. Delays provisioning these schools were encountered due to high excess construction costs which were primarily a result of poor telecommunications infrastructure in the area.

This work was led by practitioners, working with other educational professionals and experts and will inform the next stage of the reforms, the development of the Areas of Learning and Experience (AoLEs). The four purposes noted in Successful Futures, including the development of healthy, confident individuals will be at the heart of the new curriculum and will be the starting point for all decisions on the content and experiences developed as part of the new curriculum and assessment arrangements. Our education improvement plan 'Qualified for Life' will also include Well-being as a fifth objective in its next iteration. Work on the AoLEs will start this month. The Health and Well-being AoLE will draw on subjects and themes from mental, physical and emotional well-being and will also consider how the school environment supports children and young peoples' social, emotional, spiritual and physical health and well-being. Schools play an important role in supporting the emotional health and wellbeing of learners. This support can range from universal interventions, such as social and emotional learning programmes or teaching mindfulness, to more specialist interventions, such as nurture groups and the provision of counselling services by local authorities in schools and community settings. The Health and Well-being AoLE will consider such initiatives and make recommendations on how to build on the best practice currently in place across the sector. Discussions have been held with organisations such as Mind Cymru about the new curriculum and as the development work progresses there will be opportunities for these and other organisations to feed in to the process.

The hillfort dates from the first Millennium BC and is the largest example of its type in Ceredigion. It is privately owned, managed and maintained. Conservation of earthwork Scheduled Monuments such as Pen Dinas hillfort is primarily achieved through sensitive land management. Owners of scheduled monuments are encouraged to contact the Welsh Government's historic environment service, Cadw, for advice or to request a site visit if they have any concerns about the condition or management of protected designated monuments on their land. Cadw's team of Field Monument Wardens operate a rolling programme of inspections to monitor and record the condition of scheduled monuments and to provide conservation advice. Scheduled Monuments are protected by law from activities that could damage or disturb buried archaeological remains such as excavation, ground disturbance and metal detecting. Anyone wishing to carry out such activities needs formally to apply to Welsh Ministers for Scheduled Monument Consent. Acting without such consent may be a criminal offence liable for prosecution under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 (as amended and strengthened by the Historic Environment Act (Wales) 2016. The new legislation makes it easier to bring forward a prosecution in instances of deliberate damage, for example damage associated with metal detecting activity.

Employers are responsible for recruiting and retaining nurses through workforce planning, designing fulfilling jobs, offering attractive terms and conditions of employment, and providing good support to their staff. In support of this, the Welsh Government increased the volume of nurse training places for the 2016/17 intake. This was the highest level of nurse training places commissioned in Wales since devolution. This equated to a 10% increase in the number of nursing training places commissioned compared to the previous intake, which is in addition to the 22% increase for the 2015/16 intake. Commissioning numbers for the academic year 2017/18 will be announced in early February. In response to concerns about the fragility of the care home sector, the Welsh Government established a Care Homes Steering Group engaging stakeholders to explore how care home services, including the care home workforce could be better supported. This has included examining the scope of the nursing role to consider how some nursing activities can be appropriately delegated to other care staff to maximise the skill mix within care homes, so that nurses can more effectively focus the use of their time, for example, by specialising on more technical and complex care activities. The Welsh Government also invests financial resources in the social care workforce. It provides an annual £10m grant, including a match funded element from local authorities, to improve the quality of social care provision through a planned approach to training. The funding increases the proportion of staff across the whole social care sector with the qualifications, skills and knowledge they need for the work they do. Looking forwards, Social Care Wales is being formed from the Care Council for Wales.

The Welsh Government remains committed to ensuring that we recruit and retain the very best teachers with the highest levels of knowledge and skills to support the effective delivery of a new curriculum for Wales.

All Initial Teacher Education Centres in Wales actively promote their courses to recruit the very best and brightest individuals into teaching and not simply recruit to meet targets. Ultimately, we seek to ensure that the right people with the right skills are deployed and remain in our schools to provide a high quality and motivated workforce.

The deal also limits the quota of tariff reduced beef which can be imported. Beef entering the EU from Canada is limited to a tonnage equivalent to only 0. 6% of the continent's current consumption.

However, this competition usually takes place for trade customers, whilst householders usually make use of the waste services provided by their Local Authority. Where private companies offer waste and recycling services, they must ensure that they are fully compliant with all applicable regulations relating to the collection, carrying, treatment and disposal of wastes. Householders and trade customers must also comply with their duty of care responsibilities when contracting for commercial waste and recycling services.   As regards the operation of trade waste services, Local Authorities try to encourage high levels of recycling amongst their trade customers, though it should be noted that trade waste recycling levels are typically lower than those from residents.  Where Local Authority trade customers move to being served by private companies the effect on recycling performance will, if anything, be beneficial to the Local Authority. This is because, typically, the non-recyclable material which it no longer collects weighs more than what is recycled. Where private companies offer waste collection services to residents the uptake is usually so small that it makes financial viability difficult. One exception is with house clearances, which provide sufficient revenues for waste companies to be able to offer such services at a profit. There is evidence that some operators are operating illegally and have collected waste and then illegally disposed of it through fly-tipping.

I am confident that the new legislation and policies we have introduced will achieve real advances in services and support for people with autism. The Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 which commenced implementation in April last year will transform the way we meet the needs of all people with care and support needs in Wales, including people with autism and their carers. The Act puts the individual at the heart of decisions about their own care and support including defining their own wellbeing outcomes. Specific reference is made to ensuring the needs of people with autism are identified and addressed. The refreshed Autistic Spectrum Disorder Strategic Action Plan published on 30th November 2016 was accompanied by a delivery plan to monitor implementation and measure the progress we are making. The key actions in the plan will be delivered through an all-age National Integrated Autism Service which is being rolled out across Wales. This is backed by £6 million Welsh Government investment over three years which will be delivered through our Regional Partnership Boards. These boards were formed under the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014 and will ensure health boards, local authorities and the third sector are working together. The service will see new specialist teams in every region providing adult diagnosis, support in the community and advice and information for adults with autism, parents and carers and professionals. The first four regions: Cardiff and Vale, Cwm Taf, Gwent and Powys will offer this service from June this year and the roll out will be completed across Wales by March 2019. The new integrated autism service will sit alongside improvements we are making to neurodevelopmental diagnosis and support for children through the Together for Children and Young People programme which is being supported by £2m funding each year. We are setting health boards a new waiting time target of 26 weeks from referral to first assessment appointment for both children and adults and will be collecting this data from the summer. The Additional learning Needs (ALN) system being developed to replace the existing Special Educational Need system will provide for a radical new approach to supporting learners with ALN across the 0 to 25 age range including those with autism. The ALN Transformation Programme, already underway, is delivering improvements in practice now, including the new Learning with Autism primary school programme, launched last March, which was very well received. Similar resources are now being developed for early years, secondary schools and further education. The Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act and our new National Integrated Autism Service will work alongside the new refreshed Strategic Action Plan and Additional Learning Needs reforms to achieve long lasting improvements to the services and support available for children, young people and adults with autism and their families. Nonetheless, the Welsh Government has made a commitment to consider, in the future, the need for autism legislation if gaps in services and support exist that can only be addressed through new legislation.",FALSE,FALSE,1652

The governing body and local authority must each ensure that sufficient, suitable staff are employed or engaged to work at the school, to provide education appropriate for the ages, aptitudes, abilities and needs of the pupils. It is for the governing body to decide the staffing structure for the school, determining the number of teacher and support staff posts, their grade and responsibilities. Local authorities make the decisions about where schools are, their size and where children are admitted. They oversee the whole system in their area and so it makes sense that they also decide how their schools are funded. This is a complex picture and we should not accept that changes to the workforce are simply a response to funding. Each year, legitimately, there are changes to the workforce as a consequence of drivers such as school reorganisation, changes to pupil numbers, and priorities at a local, regional and national level. For example, in the 10 years to 2016 there has been a reduction in both teacher and pupil numbers (about 2,000 less teachers and head teachers and about 18,000 less pupils) and the pupil teacher ratio has remained relatively stable (18. 0 to 18. 6). Whilst funding clearly has an impact, and we have been entirely transparent about the extremely difficult financial settlement from the UK Government which is impacting on our public services in Wales, we are also proud of our investment in schools. Within this context we have prioritised funding for schools within the funding we provide to Local Government in Wales and have set a Final Budget and Local Government Settlement for stability for 2017-18. The Welsh Government has also committed £100million over the next five years to improve schools standards. This is in addition to our significant school improvement funding; including for example the £93million we are providing to support schools to reduce the impact of deprivation on our learners’ attainment in 2017-18 and the £133million we will be providing through the Education Improvement Grant for Schools.",FALSE,FALSE,1672

While no formal assessment of STEM Insights has been made at this stage, my officials met the senior team at the National STEM Learning Centre in recent weeks to discuss closer working on professional learning for STEM practitioners in Wales. We will learn from the experience of others and make available successful approaches in support of our teachers.

Through formal collaboration between practitioners, education Consortia, universities and other specialist bodies, I expect the NNEST to support the development of our STEM teachers drawing on research on what works. We know STEM teachers need to be on top of industry and academic developments in their fields if they are to engage learners more fully in their subjects. I also want to strengthen links between schools and employers to raise aspirations of young people and help prepare them for life and work. For example, our Business Class project, delivered in partnership with Business in the Community and Careers Wales, provides a mechanism for stronger and more sustainable partnerships between secondary schools and employers. In addition, the growing use by schools and colleges of STEM Ambassadors in Wales shows that such opportunities, when used to best effect, provide clear benefits to learners and teachers. Building on existing programme activity, I have asked my officials to explore ways to facilitate further links between education and business, including opportunities for teacher placements into industry.

The Health Board has indicated the current full year cost forecast for providing Healthy Prestatyn services for 2016/17 is approximately £3,387,000, which includes an additional one off cost associated with locum cover during the GP recruitment process. The Health board has indicated that the Healthy Prestatyn current cost per patient is approximately £140 which compares with £136 average cost per patient for a non dispensing practice in North Denbighshire Cluster and £145 average cost per patient for North Wales. The health board’s financial plan is that the overall costs of providing the Healthy Prestatyn service, once in a ‘steady state’, are no greater than the aggregate general medical services allocation for the three GP practices for those services which are directly comparable. The Health Board also highlights that Healthy Prestatyn has reduced prescribing costs by approximately £250,000 over the period April to December 2016. The utilisation of pharmacists within the healthcare team has enabled patients to have a greater understanding of the need for regular review and their prescribed medication.

Following a review of this evidence, the Committee rejected the call to ban tackling, and did not feel that rugby participation poses an unacceptable risk of harm. The Committee also reported that the benefits of experiencing, learning, training and playing rugby, with appropriate supervision, safety and coaching, considerably outweigh the risks of injury. A recent case series study of a small number of ex-professional football players with a history of dementia found some to have had features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

For the Welsh Government the primary impacts identified of a change in discount rate will be upon the liabilities of the Welsh Risk Pool (WRP) for clinical negligence and other personal injury claims against the NHS in Wales and the potential impact upon indemnification arrangements for GPs. Initial broad estimates indicate a potential impact of £60m upon Welsh Government provisions in 2016/17 however, further detailed calculation is required and revised actuarial Ogden tables are anticipated reflecting the new rate towards the end of March 2017.

We provided funding of £0. 8m for health boards to recruit and expand their Children’s Local Primary Mental Health Services. This funding is part of the additional annual £8m provided to CAMHS to improve their services. We have also provided an additional £300k for third sector support workers to support young people with enduring mental illness to access education training and employment to promote independent living. Waiting times for young people to receive their first CAMHS assessment is reducing, reversing a trend of rising numbers in recent years. LHBs have informed us they will meet the 28 day target as projected by end of March 2017. To meet this by the target date is a real achievement for services, given the numbers originally waiting. More generally the NHS is leading the Together for Children and Young People (T4CYP) Programme, which is examining the way in which specialist mental health services work with primary care and others in social services, education, youth justice and the third sector to ensure young people have timely access to appropriate help and support to meet their needs. Engagement of children and young people underpins T4CYP through established links with the Children’s Commissioner’s office, the Young Wales fora and the High Needs Collaborative, ‘Making Sense’. Feedback is provided through regular newsletters and specific ‘You Said We Did’ reports which demonstrate how T4CYP is responding to issues raised by children and young people directly. Current work with Young Wales and Time to Change Wales includes the development of a young person’s guide to CAMHS and the use of young champions in schools to help children and young people to develop the capacity to talk more openly about mental health and well-being. I recognise the important role schools have in supporting the emotional health and well-being of Children and Young People, I recently met with the Cabinet Secretary for Education to discuss how Education and CAMHS’ joint working can improve. Officials from Education and Health are working together to look at improving the Education and CAMHS relationship. I recognise it’s not just a question of intervening when mental health problems start to emerge, although that is of course essential.

Nine GP practices are under the management of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board.

The Healthy Prestatyn primary care service, which has been run directly by the health board from 1 April 2016, provides primary care services to over 23,000 patients. In relation to the Llys Meddyg surgery in Conwy, which terminated its contract on 31 October 2016, the health board worked with neighbouring practices in Conwy, Llandudno Junction and Deganwy to ensure their patients continue to receive high quality primary care. While the General Medical Services contract model will remain the principal model in Wales, health boards are also be considering other options to ensure primary services remain sustainable, including working with practices to encourage mergers or federations. In October 2016, we launched a major new national and international campaign to promote Wales as an excellent place for doctors, including GPs, and their families, to train, work and live. The campaign is one element in delivering on the Welsh Government’s commitment to “take action to attract and train more GPs, nurses and other health professionals across Wales”. Since October, the first phase of the campaign has been progressing at pace. I issued a written statement on 4 April highlighting the early successes of the campaign. This has included an increase in the GP speciality training fill rate which at the end of round 1 was 84%, compared to 68% at the same stage last year. There have also been positive results for selected areas of Wales that are part of the financial incentive scheme.

Clinical care can never be risk free but we can take steps to reduce the risks. This is the key to addressing the costs of medical negligence. In addition, a system of redress operates in NHS Wales under the Putting Things Right process, which allows for the settlement of claims under £25,000 without the need for legal action. This helps to reduce the very high legal costs which NHS bodies are obliged to pay in many cases.

If it were, then the costs of recovery would depend on a number of variables, such as the nature of the defect, the urgency of recovering the device, availability of recovery vessels, weather conditions, etc. Before any ocean energy device can be deployed it must agree a decommissioning plan with the appropriate authority. At the time of deployment that was the Department for Energy and Climate Change, now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, and signed off by the Secretary of State for Energy. Part of any decommissioning plan requires financial security, to be payable in full, and in advance of the commencement of deployment into an escrow type account which neither party can withdraw money from without the approval of the other party, unless in matters of insolvency on the part of the developer. The financial security must be for the full value of decommissioning costs of the DeltaStream. This amount remains in the escrow account until such a time that the DeltaStream needs to be recovered. This sum has been calculated to be sufficient to recover the device back to port and to place the seabed back to the condition it was in prior to deployment.

This group has included British Sign Language alongside other languages in its discussion of the Area of Learning and Experience's scope and boundaries. This development and design is ongoing. Work on the high-level design of the Areas of Learning and Experience began in January. As part of the pioneer network, special schools are involved in the design and development of the new curriculum, representing the needs of deaf and hearing impaired learners. Stakeholders are being engaged during the development of the Areas of Learning and Experience. British Sign Language is one of the areas on which the pioneer network will seek advice. I recognise the importance of ensuring we have an education workforce that is skilled and confident in meeting a wide range of additional learning needs (ALN), including those with hearing impairments. Local authorities (LAs) are responsible for ensuring suitable educational provision for all children. This includes ensuring BSL is available to a child whose needs have been identified as requiring such provision to enable them to access the curriculum. The Welsh Government has recently announced a £20m package of funding to support implementation of the Additional Learning Needs and Education Tribunal (Wales) Bill and delivery of the wider ALN Transformation Programme. A substantial amount of the £20m will be targeted at workforce development, to ensure practitioners are fully equipped to deliver the new ALN system. We have engaged with teachers of the deaf and are aware of pressure on LAs, including specialist teacher numbers. In partnership with the WLGA we are collecting data from Heads of Service on specialist workforce issues, including BSL. This data will provide us with the intelligence needed to understand the issues and actions required. Our workforce agenda will build on the existing requirements of our teaching workforce. Teachers in Wales are required to understand and be aware of the well being, personal, emotional and social development of all learners. For learners with disabilities in particular, they should improve access to the curriculum, make physical improvements to increase participation in education and provide information in appropriate formats. This requirement is embedded very early on in the profession as the current Qualified Teacher Standards (QTS) require student teachers to demonstrate they understand the diverse learning needs of all learners. In doing so, they should endeavour to provide the best possible education for the learner to reach their potential, whatever their personal circumstances. The new accreditation criteria for initial teacher education (ITE) in Wales require future accredited providers of ITE to develop future teachers to meet the needs of all learners including those with ALN such as hearing impairment. The criteria for the accreditation of ITE programmes in Wales can be found at http://learning.gov.wales/resources/browse-all/initial-teacher-education-accreditation-criteria/?lang=en. The Welsh Government does not collect data on the number of deaf pupils in Wales receiving designated BSL lessons. However, I understand that since 2011 the Consortium for Research into Deaf Education (CRIDE) has undertaken an annual survey on educational staffing and service provision for deaf children with separate reports published for England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, which set out the results for each respective nation. The 2016 survey was not sent out to services in Scotland in light of similar work being undertaken by the Scottish Government. CRIDE have made it clear that there remain inconsistencies in how different questions are completed throughout the survey. They also indicate that response rates to individual questions sometimes vary and as a consequence the results should continue to be used with caution.",FALSE,FALSE,2305

An Advice Note and Code of Practice are in place and there are procedures to give interested parties a say on the placement of mobile masts which affect them. Planning Policy Wales and Technical Advice Note 19: Telecommunications, gives details on the process of consultation that should take place between the mobile operator and a body potentially affected by the installation of a mobile telephone mast through the planning system. It also gives guidance on how this evidence should be considered by Planning Authorities. Where a mast is to be installed on or near a school or college, it is important that operators discuss the proposed development with the relevant body of the school or college concerned (e. g. the school's governing body or the corporation/ institution of the college) before submitting an application for planning permission or prior approval to the local planning authority. When making the application the operator should provide evidence to the local planning authority that they have consulted the relevant body of the school or college. Where an application has been submitted to the local planning authority for planning permission or prior approval with respect to a mobile phone base station either on or near a school or college, the local planning authority should consult the relevant bodies and should take into account any relevant views expressed. Consultation should be in the form of written notification to the relevant body inviting comments by a specified date. Health considerations can be material when determining applications for planning permission or prior approval, as can public concerns in relation to such effects. Whether such matters are material is ultimately a matter for the courts, as it is for the decision-maker to determine what weight to attach to such considerations in any particular case. The Welsh Government is advised by Public Health England (PHE) in relation to the protection of communities from exposure to radiofrequencies and electromagnetic fields. PHE advises that exposures to electromagnetic fields should comply with the guidelines on limiting such exposure published by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In addition, PHE keeps emerging scientific studies worldwide under review and publishes comprehensive reviews of the evidence from time to time. The most recent comprehensive review of the potential health effect of radio waves was carried out by the Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR), an independent advisory group reporting to PHE. The group's report was published in April 2012 and concludes that 'although a substantial amount of research has been conducted in this area, there is no convincing evidence that radio wave exposures below guideline levels cause health effects in either adults or children. ' The AGNIR review includes a summary of several thousand measurements of public exposure levels that have been made by Ofcom near to mobile phone masts. The maximum exposure found at any location was hundreds of times below the ICNIRP guideline levels, and typical exposures were lower still.

The disease has not yet been detected in the UK. Welsh Government works with a range of partners in order to monitor and manage tree health and diseases. With Forest Research, we have plant health information available on our stands at the Royal Welsh Show and on their websites. People who are concerned are being encouraged to report diseases on the Forest Research Tree Alert website. Some examples of ongoing tree health work are:· ‘Tree Health’ days for stakeholders to be briefed on tree and plant health issues, organised by Farming Connect and Forest Research. · Joint seminars about tree health awareness and key pests are undertaken by NRW with Forest Research. · NRW provides awareness training to external groups and stakeholders such as the Wildlife Trusts.

Our Healthy Child Wales Programme (HCWP) provides a structured, national programme for children and their families to improve health, social and educational development and long term physical, mental and social outcomes. We would expect this to reduce the likelihood of injuries in a variety of ways. As set out in our guidance document Safe and effective intervention – use of reasonable force and searching for weapons, we expect schools to have a wellbeing-focused ethos in place that lessens the risk and threat of violence of any kind. With regard to instances of self harm, the Health and Education portfolios are working together to take forward a pilot programme to test several models of intervention. The overall aim is to reduce emotional distress and prevent mental illnesses by offering early support, and appropriate referrals and interventions. The Road Safety Framework for Wales sets out the actions the Welsh Government and our partners will take to meet our casualty reduction targets.

The unit is currently open 10. 00am to 6. 00pm, seven days a week. The health board took this decision on clinical safety grounds, given the challenges in the recruitment of paediatric consultants, combined with particular problems in Pembrokeshire due to the retirement of one consultant coinciding with the maternity leave of another. The temporary changes meant that families could continue to access healthcare for their children in the usual ways. Children are referred and, if necessary, transferred to the service and hospital to best meet their needs.  The health board has continued to work hard to attract and recruit suitably qualified staff to join its paediatric medical team, including the launch of a targeted paediatric recruitment strategy in February 2017. Unfortunately, this has not resulted in the recruitment of a sufficient number of consultants to currently support the re-establishment of the 12 hour PACU service. At its Board meeting on 27 July, the health board therefore agreed to continue the eight hour service, whilst recruitment attempts continue. I am assured that the current arrangements are being monitored closely, to ensure they provide a safe service for children and families in Pembrokeshire.

This group has been assessing and reviewing alternative future staffing and service model scenarios to support a safe and sustainable paediatric ambulatory care service at the hospital, if the recruitment position does not improve.  The group, which is also supported by representatives from the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust and Hywel Dda Community Health Council, has made significant progress in identifying a range of possible scenarios whilst overseeing ongoing recruitment efforts. To further support this work, the health board has commissioned external, independent clinical facilitation to work with staff and their respective clinical teams to further review these scenarios.  Once this work is complete, the health board plans to commence a period of engagement during the autumn, if the recruitment position has not sufficiently improved to support the re-establishment of a 12 hour, seven days per week PACU service at the hospital.",TRUE,FALSE,2612

I am committed to putting effective pupil support in place to ensure that children and young people are physically and emotionally ready to learn. This is why we're adding Wellbeing as a key objective in the next iteration of Qualified for Life, our education improvement plan. It was implicit before, but now it will be made explicit. We have some interesting evidence around pupil support. The Public Policy Institute for Wales convened an expert group in November 2015, to provide advice on the best ways to provide effective pupil support in secondary schools. PPIW published a report in 2015 to summarise the findings of the expert group. The Successful Futures report by Professor Graham Donaldson identified four purposes of education – one of which is to support children and young people to become healthy, confident individuals. In addition, the report sets out 6 Areas of Learning Experiences (AoLEs) as central to the structure of the new curriculum; one of these AoLEs is Health and well-being. Pioneer Schools and practitioners are at the heart of the development of the new curriculum, working with education professionals and other experts across Wales and beyond (including; Estyn, regional consortia, Higher Education, business and other key partners). It is their collective expertise that will shape the new curriculum and the underpinning national approach to professional Learning. The next phase of AoLE development will present further opportunities to align professional learning requirements with work to develop, populate and test evolving models for each AoLE (Strand 3). This approach will also ensure early identification of emerging professional learning requirements, including strategies to support health and well being.",FALSE,FALSE,2798

And it is clear if we are to achieve our transformational education reforms we will require a high-quality education workforce that is vibrant, engaged and committed to continuous learning for all. For this to happen, we must get Wales’ initial teacher education (ITE) offer right. In the future ITE Partnerships (that is a university and a representative group of schools) will design and deliver ITE programmes that support the four purposes of the curriculum for Wales and address the six areas of learning and experience. To ensure more specific consideration of how ITE programmes will raise the quality of ITE provision I have empowered the Education Workforce Council (EWC) to accredit individual ITE programmes, through the establishment of the Initial School Teacher Training Committee (“the Board”). In future, all new and existing programmes of ITE will need to be accredited by the Board, who will decide whether a proposed programme of ITE realises the vision for ITE and addresses every matter referred to in the Criteria. In doing so, the Board will seek to ensure that any programme is demanding, credible and professionally appropriate. Accreditation makes clear that it is expected that ITE Partnerships will develop approaches to assist aspiring teachers to manage their own wellbeing, as well as their ability to contribute to the wellbeing of the pupils in their care. For both groups, it is important that they are supported to overcome barriers to their learning and to help them in having positive physical, social and mental states. ITE programmes should also include opportunities for understanding the role of wellbeing in effective learning, including the ability to identify pupils who are at risk of experiencing poor wellbeing, and should provide opportunities for students to examine the most effective models deployed by schools and their partners to improve the wellbeing of all learners. The Criteria for the accreditation of initial teacher education programmes in Wales: Teaching Tomorrows’ Teachers published 15 March, alongside the new professional teaching and leadership standards, reflects shared ambitions and pride for the profession. From initial teacher education, into the classroom and through career-long professional learning, our national approach focusses on ensuring and further developing a high-quality teaching profession.",FALSE,FALSE,2799

The Programme aims to identify and describe patterns and causes of child death including any trends and to recommend actions to reduce the risk of avoidable factors contributing to child deaths in Wales. The Thematic Review of Deaths of Children and Young People Through Probable Suicide 2016-2012 influenced our work including informing Talk to Me 2, the national suicide and self harm prevention strategy, which was launched in July 2015. The recommendations in the Review are now being taken forward as part of our Talk to Me 2 work. Progress reports by the National Advisory Group on Suicide and Self-Harm will be undertaken on an annual basis and progress will also be reported regularly as part of our reporting arrangements for the wider Together for Mental Health Strategy, of which Talk to Me 2 forms a key component. Fortunately suicides among children and young people remain relatively scarce. The Office for National Statistics published Suicides in England and Wales, 2015 registrations on 7 September 2016. Between 1981 and 2015, suicides in the 10-14 age group remained low, with 13 deaths in total. In the 15 to 19 age group, the picture remains relatively static UK-wide over the last 30 years. In Wales, annual deaths in this age group generally range from high single figures to the mid to low teens, down from the peak of 23 in 2000. Numbers vary year on year, which you would expect, as the total Welsh numbers are so small and allowing for normal statistical variation any consequent interpretation of rates should be viewed with extreme caution. I will, however, take advice from the Talk to Me 2 National Advisory Group on the need to commission another thematic review at this time, or in the near future. In terms of managing and treating self-harm in children and young people, we expect health boards to work to NICE guidelines in relation to all mental health conditions, including self-harm. We have made great strides in recent years to improve and speed up access to services for young people who may present as a result of self-harm or suicidal ideation. School counselling services are available to children in all secondary schools and in year six in primary schools. Statistics released in March 2017 showed that of the over 11,000 young people who received counselling in 2015/16, over 10% were referred due to self-harm or suicidal feelings.

This includes literacy support if required. The programme is aimed at unemployed adults who have a reasonable chance of being ready for employment within six months. The Welsh Government-funded Adult Community Learning Grant and part-time Further Education provision provides flexible learning opportunities for adults. Priority is given to the provision of Essential Skills (including adult literacy and numeracy), English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Digital Literacy. These courses are free to learners up to the level of functionality which is the ability to read, write and speak in English or Welsh, and to use mathematics, at a level necessary to function and progress both in work and society. The Communities for Work (CfW) programme makes a significant contribution to tackling illiteracy among adults. CfW Employment Mentors and Advisers work intensively with participants to identify and overcome barriers preventing them taking up training or employment including low literacy and numeracy. This could include basic skills training, ESOL lessons. CfW is available to individuals aged 16 plus living in Communities First clusters throughout South Wales East excluding Monmouthshire. A number of programmes funded by the European Social Fund (ESF) support individuals with their literacy skills. These support the European Union's goal of increasing employment by giving unemployed and disadvantaged people the training and support they need to enter jobs. One of the main aims of ESF is to invest in skills as a driver of productivity and growth, to aid progression within employment and to improve the skills mix and diversity of our workforce.
